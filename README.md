-Aight so first you want to install react-expo on your computer using **npm install --global expo-cli** <br />
-Then install the "expo go" app on your phone <br />
-Clone this repo, navigate to the folder, and run **yarn add expo** <br />
-run **expo start**, and scan the QR code. If you are on the same wifi network as your phone, should work well. If it doesnt, click "Tunnel" in the browser window thing and try the new QR code.
